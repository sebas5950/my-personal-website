        <p>
            This will be a brief background to how I got here and why I'm here. I originally went to school for criminal justice thinking I would like it (big suprise I didnt), when I realised i hated it, it was too late I was 2 years into school and didn't want to pay more and hold my future back longer. I always wanted to change majors to computer science, but was afraid I was not that smart. I finished school and ended up goiong from job to job not really ever staying in one place I enjoyed. There was always the thought of learning or wanting to go back to programming or computer science, but I felt too old. One day at work I decided there has to be a change to the routine of getting up and going to work. I then decided to quit and learn to code, join a bootcamp and do my best to get into the tech industry. I feel this is the best decision I've made and im excited to see wher this takes me and where I end up from here.
